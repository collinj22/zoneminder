# This requires ZM 1.32 
# After you update to ZM 1.32, replace these files from ZM master and overwrite the existing ones in your ZM server: 
# You may also needs files from master that were updated on Oct 11. If your build/package is older, you may need to pull them

# If you use this URL as I've specified below, keep the EVENTID phrase intact. 
# The notification server will replace it with the correct eid of the alarm

# To make sure it works, replace the picture_url value with:
# https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Bird_in_flight_wings_spread.jpg
# if it works, but your images don't you have a server access issue

# If 1, the text returned by the script
# overwrites the alarm header 
# useful if your script is detecting people, for example
